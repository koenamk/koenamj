## Hi!
I am Koena; thanks for stopping by! I am a math major at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), and enjoy exploring cities, 
thoughts, and ideas. I've lived in Dubai, Halifax, Toronto and Waterloo. I am currently working with 
data at [RBC](https://www.rbcinsurance.com/en-ca/about/). I'm interested in data, biology, history,
and especially where these things collide. 

When I’m not studying, you can find me: playing tennis, reading, painting, trying out a new ramen spot in Toronto. Visit my [Curius](https://curius.app/koena-m) page to see what I’m reading online!

I love meeting new people, whether it is to chat about mutual interests, or to learn about whatever it is 
you geek out on. Although  I can't guarantee an immediate reply, I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I invite 
you to reach out using the social links above!
