# In Tokyo 🗼
## Day 1
- Took the train to Asakusa. Visited Senso-ji and Nakamise Shopping Street, where I tried dango for the first time.
- Wandered the Ueno park, visited the Tokyo National Museum. Be mindful of the hours, and if you're 
a student ( non-Japanese universities are accepted), you can buy the student tickets! 
- Went to Sumida river boardwalk, walked around and took pictures near Skytree. Visited a cafe.

## Day 2
- Headed to Otemachi Stn. to see the Imperial Palace. Walked around the grounds of the palace, spent around 3 hours.
- Walked to Marunouchi area to eat lunch in the building with Maruzen (a stationary store I wanted to buy some fountain pens from). Had a delicious salmon steak and oysters.
- Bought said fountain pens, wandered around bookstore, and ended up reading a copy of the Metropolis, an English magazine for readers in Japan. 
- Walked down to Ginza, did some shopping at UniQlo's flagship store and other spots. Loved the architecture of the stores there, spent the better half of the evening there.
- Took the train to Toyosu. So, a great way to see Tokyo's skyline and waterfront is to take the Yurikamome line to the last stop and ride back! (credits to my host's dad)
- Got off the train at Odaiba for dinner at Aqua City mall with my friend and her family! Bought my first pair of sneakers from Onitsuka Tiger here!

# Starting Kyoto from here! 🍡
## Day 3
- Leaving for Kyoto, train for 10am. Booked the Nozomi line Shinkansen from Tokyo station to Kyoto station. Nozomi line skips over multiple stops in between, and is the train bound for Osaka. Keep some time on hand to navigate Tokyo station- its fairly easy, but I did need to use my Japanese to confirm I was on the right platform. Follow signs for Tōkaidō, Sanyō lines. Also, 'sen' means line, so you can use that word. To ask for the correct station/platform, say "(station name) iki (which means station) mate doyate ikimasuka?". Apologies for poor transliteration; open to correction.
- Reached Kyoto for 1pm. My check-in was for 2pm. So, I walked to my hotel (Daiwa Roynet, I had a pleasant experience), dropped off my baggage, and walked to a ramen spot: Ramen Daiei. Highly recommend.
- Checked into hotel.
- Took the bus to Chionin Temple, where I bought my Goshuin stamp book. This temple closes at 4pm. It is beautiful- I recommend visiting. Walked around and explored the area, very peaceful and not too crowded.
- Walked to Yasaka Shrine, super-beautiful too.
- Stopped by a matcha cafe, tried my first-ever traditionally brewed cup of matcha.
- Walked through Gion, saw the Yasaka pagoda. Gion is a beautiful district; super-crowded, but so worth it. Probably my favourite area. 
- Visited Kiyomizu Dera temple. My favourite temple in Kyoto. The view of Kyoto was stunning; saw the sunset from here.
- Took the bus/train to Fushimi Inari (open all day). Was relatively empty, and had a lovely experience. Walked through the famous Tori gates. Can get a bit scary, since its dimly-lit and very quiet. Also situated on a mountain. 10/10.

## Day 4
- Took a bus (~ 45 mins) to Kamigamo shrine. Has a beautiful garden, and is soo peaceful and calm early morning!
- Bus to Kinkaku-ji (~ 30 mins). So worth it, average crowds. Architecture is stunning.
- Took the bus to Nijo-jo. Turns out the better part of the castle was closed that day- watch out for that! This was on a Tuesday.
- Went to Heian Jingu instead. Great architecture. Ate an amazing roasted sweet potato from the market at the entrance- reminded me of home. 
- Bus to Ginkaku-ji. The area is massive, and took me some time to explore. Very worth it, however, Ginkaku-ji itself paled in comparison to Kinkaku-ji. Still a gorgeous structure. Perhaps I have a preference for gold, shiny architecture. However, the gardens here were better.
- Wandering around, I stumbled upon Hachi shrine. I really loved this place. Very empty- I was the only one there. Mystical feeling. And has a veryy long [history](https://hachijinjya.amebaownd.com/pages/3682478/blog) (the best part)!
- Walked down the Philosopher's Path- was not there during the cherry blossom season, but it was one of my best walks anyway. 
- Visited Nanzen-ji. Very beautiful temple, and has a great many stairs. Worth visiting.
- Visited Nishiki Market and explored Shijō-Kawaramachi area for the rest of the evening.
- Discovered Ohayo's milk custard at 7-eleven: my all-time favourite, and something I bought every day following day 4.

## Day 5
- Nijo castle in the morning. 
- Went to Gion area again, because I loved it. Had lunch at a tempura and sushi spot there.
- Visited Sanjusangendo. This is where you have the 1001 Buddhas, and they all look unique! 10/10, totally worth visiting, and very well-preserved! Be mindful because visitors aren't allowed to take pictures. There is a lot of [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanj%C5%ABsangen-d%C5%8D) here. 
- Last temple, which was a 20-min walk from my hotel, was Toji-michi. Explored the grounds, but didn't visit the pagoda because I had my 5pm train back to Tokyo. 
- Plan for dinner was to visit Tokyo station's ramen street, but I didn't have the energy to do so.

# Tokyo Again! 🚅
## Day 6
- Meiji Jingu in Shibuya. Absolutely worth visiting- 10/10!! Loved walking around the area- it's hard to believe that you can find such
serenity within a bustling city. 
- Walked down to Takeshita street, ate lunch at Ippudo. 
- Visited the Hello Kitty store.
- Walked down to Harajuku and saw the famous blue building- the architecture is truly stunning!
- Walked down Kitaaoyama area, really cool area.
- Walked down to Shibuya, saw Shibuya crossing. 
- Went to Shinjuku, found a KFC to eat at- its tradition in Japan to eat at KFC on Christmas! Be sure to order your KFC online beforehand; they only offer chicken strips and some other items if you don't preorder.
- Went bar-hunting in Kabukicho. Found a cool place called Bar PSY with a large selection of drinks. I had an Umeshu + Soda mix, and its was delicious!

# To Hakone and Mt. Fuji 🗻
## Day 7
- Train to Hakone. Went on the romance car for views and nice seats (had reserved that previously).
- Hakone loop- start at Hakone-Yumoto station, Hakone Tozan Railway → Gōra (a very scenic trip and I highly recommend), Cable Car → Sōunzan,
take the Ropeway → Owakudani from here (there is also a place to soak your feet at Owakudani if you have the time!, also try the black eggs), Continue Ropeway → Togendai, take the Lake Ashi cruise from Togendai, get off the boat at Motohakone-ko. Ideally, you could see the Hakone shrine here, but we were rather late.
- Went to our hotel, had a kaiseki-style dinner which was delicious. Then I went to the onsen!! 10/10, highly recommend this experience.

## Day 8
- Onsen again.
- Breakfast.
- Hakone Shrine. If you've already seen that, I highly recommend going to Daiyuzan Saijojo.
- Took the bus to Amazake Chaya. This is a teahouse that's been quite the same since its foundations, on the Old Tokaido Road. This was such a wonderful experience for me, because I was transported back in time as I thought about all the travellers who'd taken the same route before me. There used to be many teahouses on this road, but only a few, if not just this one, remain. If you find yourself here, try the amasake- its the signature cha, and tastes quite like payesh (if you're Bengali)! It was delicious. Then, as we waited for the bus, I decided to wander around, and stumbled upon the original chaya, which is now preserved as a simple rest place for travellers with free wifi! There was nobody here, and the interior was quite old. I loved this place.
- If you have a day, on your journey back to Tokyo, I recommend stopping at Odawara. 
- Went to Shinjuku (again), had some ramen (of course), and went back to Bar PSY (too tired to locate some new bar). 

# Tokyo again 🍣
## Day 9
- Went to Akihabara. Bought some JJK and Haikyuu merch. 
- Had lunch at Sushiro (highly recommend).
- Went to Akasaka to see some Christmas decorations and explored the area. Stumbled upon another shrine, which I loved.
- Had some tea and dessert at a nice cafe in Akasaka.
- Went to 1-chome to take pictures of the Tokyo Tower, Minato city. I'd seen a reel on Instagram about finding the best spot, and I had forgotten to save the address. So I wandered around 1-chome until I found the ideal spot. It was empty, and I got my favourite pictures of Tokyo!
- Tried Starbucks! How did I completely miss this? It is VERY different to what I find in Canada, and I highly recommend trying it there! What I appreciated the most was the a smaller size than tall, and the variety of flavours! Had the Hojicha latte.

# Experienced the joy of being a kid again
## Day 10
- Walked to Ojima park, and played at the park with the other kids for more than an hour.
- Was hungry, so my friend and I had ramen (YAY!). 
- Flight back from Haneda airport. Be sure to be early and visit the deck, was flight-watching for about an hour and some. 

# Goodbye, Japan! 🛫
## Day 11 
- Missed Japan very much, and will visit again!
