# Some of the links I checked out while I was planning my trip to Japan

1. [Solo Female Travel Kyoto](https://www.psimonmyway.com/solo-female-travel-japan/#kyoto-solo-female-travel-japan)
2. [A Guide to Areas in Tokyo](https://www.gotokyo.org/en/destinations/index.html)
3. [Wikitravel's Guide for Japan](https://wikitravel.org/en/Off_the_beaten_track_in_Japan). This is a bit outdated, but can still be very useful!
4. [36 Hours in Tokyo, New York Times, 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/27/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-tokyo-japan.html). Again, a bit outdated, but its still a good read, especially if you happen to be there for a short time.
5. [36 Hours in Kyoto, New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/travel/36-hours-in-kyoto-japan.html). Similar to the aforementioned.
6. [List of Kissatens](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/restaurants/best-kissaten-coffee-shops-in-tokyo). Kissatens are Japanese-style coffee shops, and I really wanted to explore this. Another link to find your favourite [kissaten](https://foodsaketokyo.com/category/kissaten/), and a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoTravel/comments/1if0fov/recommended_retro_cosy_and_quaint_kissatens/) with people discussing it.

**This is a work in progress. If you have any links you'd like to add to this list, feel free to reach out!**
